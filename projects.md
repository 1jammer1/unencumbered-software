| Name | Summary | Repository |
| :--- | :------ | :--------- |
| [anaphoric-variants](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/anaphoric-variants/) | Gives access to anaphoric variants of operators through one macro: ANAPHORIC. The user explicitly provides a variable name, preserving sanity, in contrast to the traditional use of an evil implicit variable ("IT"). Some operators can bind additional handy variables when explicitly requested. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexstream/anaphoric-variants) |
| [asciiart](https://github.com/frankbraun/asciiart) | Parser for hierarchical ASCII art. | [GitHub](https://github.com/frankbraun/asciiart) |
| [bubble-operator-upwards](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/bubble-operator-upwards/) | A function that "bubbles an operator upwards" in a form, demultiplexing all alternative branches by way of cartesian product. This operation is notably useful for easy implementation of certain kinds of shorthand notations in macros. A cartesian-product function is also exported, as it's needed to implement the main function. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexstream/bubble-operator-upwards) |
| [c-timer-lib](https://github.com/HighPerLab/c-timer-lib) | A C/C++ interface to system/hardware clocks for high-precision time measurements. | [GitHub](https://github.com/HighPerLab/c-timer-lib) |
| [cartesian-product-switch](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/cartesian-product-switch/) | A macro for choosing the appropriate form to execute according to the combined results of multiple tests. This is a straightforward and efficient alternative to the convoluted ad-hoc conditionals one might otherwise resort to. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexstream/cartesian-product-switch) |
| [Clientele.rs](https://crates.io/crates/clientele) | Makes it easy to write superb command-line utilities in Rust that follow consistent best practices on Linux, macOS, and Windows. | [GitHub](https://github.com/artob/clientele.rs) |

An ENHANCED-EVAL-WHEN alias is also supported, as well as an EVAL-ALWAYS macro and package nickname, for good measure. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexstream/enhanced-eval-when) |
| [enhanced-multiple-value-bind](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/enhanced-multiple-value-bind/) | Provides an enhanced MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND macro that adds support for lambda keywords by expanding to a MULTIPLE-VALUE-CALL when necessary. This makes catching multiple-value &rest and &key much more lightweight and convenient. A MULTIPLE-VALUE-&BIND alias is supported. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexstream/enhanced-multiple-value-bind) |
| [first-time-value](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/first-time-value/) | Returns the result of evaluating a form in the current lexical and dynamic context the first time it's encountered, and the cached result of that computation on subsequent evaluations. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexstream/first-time-value) |

| [incognito-keywords](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/incognito-keywords/) | Introduces a new kind of keyword that looks just like any non-keyword symbol and allows safe usage of convenient but clashy symbol names by multiple libraries without conflicts through sharing. Some names that might benefit are (alist blist plist macro operator index &doc &decl &rest+ &destructure &ignored &ignorable). | [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexstream/incognito-keywords) |
